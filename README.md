# nyc-taxi-tip-predictor

The NYC Taxi and Limousines Commission (TLC) collects trip data records from yellow and green taxis, and for hire vehicles. These records have information regarding pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, distances, fares, rate types, payment types, and passenger counts. 
When doing this project I will be analyzing and gaining insights from trip records collected by TLC. The project will involve data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling to build predictive models and generate actionable insights for improving taxi and FHV services. The goal of this project is to gain an understanding of transportation patterns / trends in NYC. 

The prediction I will be making with my model is on tips. My objective is to predict the tip amount before the trip begins (based on pickup hour, day of week, number of passengers, pickup and drop off locations). This can help in estimation tips, helping customers in understanding additional costs. It can also help drivers and taxi companies in understanding patterns in tipping which can improve both services and salaries.
